# bitcrawler - DHT crawler for the BitTorrent protocol

An experimental crawler for BitTorrent, made with the main goal of learning a bit more
about BitTorrent and DHT. Do not expect a perfectly made piece of software.

Most of the protocol is made from scratch, and some incompatibilities or security concerns might arise.

## Development

A standard cargo project, just use `cargo run` / `cargo build` as always.
